# Explore & Summarize Data: For Baseball

--------

## Summary

----------

I decided for the Baseball data set including the basic data of 1157 baseball players. In the appendix you see further analysis of the data in R. I looked at the features, the distributions and correaltions to define a storyline. The two main additions/changes I made are:

- Data cleaning - removed player with avg=0 and HR=0
- we had player with the same name, to distugish them I added the initial for preferred hand to the name
- introduce a new feature Body Mass Index (BMI - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index), more infos under this link


Storylines:

- The is a high correlation between weight and height and the performance of a baseball player. Performance as measured in Home Runs and Batting average
- In addition the handedness as an influnce too
- I wanted to use a naimation to expalin the audience the impact of BMI and Handedness on perfromacne metric, by showing the distribution of the players as a scatterplot
- in addition the audience can explore themselves by filtering the data nad find the best players and tehir indicators
- decided for the scatterplot since I was mainly intrested in the dsitribution of the baseball players by certain metric

## Design

--------

Attached my first d3.js charts to make the outlined story (see summarize) expalnatory.

<b>Sketch 1:</b> Introduce a category feature to explore HR by average by BMI-Index
![alt text](img/Sketch1.jpg)
<end>

<b>Sketch 2:</b> Look at handedness by HR and avaerage
![alt text](img/Sketch2.jpg)
<end>

<b>Sketch 3:</b> Explore bubble chart, the size represents the sum of HR by category BMI, average. In addition the color represents handedness
![alt text](img/Sketch3.jpg)
<end>

<b>Sketch 4:</b> Use scatterplot to show players by BMI on a grid of HR and average, use color to show handedness
![alt text](img/Sketch4.jpg)
<end>

SKetch 4 was the winner and will be used to further enhance the story.

Design choices:

- log 2 basis for HR - why
- change to Google colors and use opacity to show desnsity
- remove gridlines and reduce to minmum
- add animation and additiona chart to show HR distribution by BMI support expantory
- change text for axis and legend
- add filter options to provide eploartory capnbilities

# Notice that the parameter "echo" was set to FALSE for this code chunk.
# This prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output.
# You should set echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file.

```

```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}
# Load the Data
rw <- read.csv("baseball_data.csv")
```

Based on the insights I tested 2 apporaves Boxplot and scatter plot (see sketches)

### Analysing and understand the dataset
```{r echo=TRUE, Analysis}
str(rw)     #Compactly Display the Structure of an Arbitrary R Object
summary(rw) #Object SUmmaries
```

Initial observations:


To first explore this data visually, I'll use the ggpair function and apply it to the data-set "rw". This will give me quick insights on the 5 variables. The intention here is to see a quick distribution of the values.


```{r echo=FALSE, Initial_Observations2}
# included the jpg since the processing time is too long
#ggpairs(rw, columns = 2:9, title="Quick insights on dataset Baseball")
```
