#Summary 
Baseball players performances plotted against various variables using dimple.js. 
The animated part of the visualisation let the reader see how baseball players 
handedness affect more their home runs than their batting average. It 
then let the readers to choose the type of plots, visual encodings and variables
to find out their own conclusions. 

#Design
I choosed bar charts to help the reader compare performances for different handednesses.
A different colour is used to put emphasis on ambidextrous players since their 
low home run values are more visible compared to their batting average.
